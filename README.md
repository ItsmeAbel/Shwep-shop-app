# ShoppingSystem
A fully functional mock of a shopping system made from scratch using C# and the .NET Framework.
The program is a desktop app that comes with two separate views.
First view is for customers where they can browse, search, and buy items in multiple quantities from the store. They receive a digital receipt upon purchasing products.
They also have the option to return products they have previously purchased through the shop. 
The second view is for employees where they can fill up on products and even order additional products form external source.



- Fronend-Backend used as a separation of concerns

- CSV file system used as a database for local product storage.

- REST APIs are used to synchronize the data in the local data with external data.
